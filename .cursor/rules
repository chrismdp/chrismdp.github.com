# Writing Style Rules

## Voice and Tone
- Write in a direct, conversational style
- Use first person when sharing personal experiences
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Keep a casual, approachable tone while maintaining expertise

## Structure
- Start with a clear, bold statement of the main argument
- Follow with a brief explanation of why this matters
- Use clear section headings to break up content
- Include a "more" break after the introduction
- End with concrete takeaways or next steps

## Content
- Draw from personal experience and lessons learned
- Include specific examples and stories
- Acknowledge counterarguments
- Focus on practical, actionable insights
- Call out mistakes and what was learned from them
- Subtly link to other posts I have written when directly relevant (look in the _posts folder)

## Format
- Use bold text sparingly for emphasis
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use bullets very sparingly - prefer to use short direct paragraphs with headings
- Don't use H1 (#) only H2 (##) and below.
- Include footnotes for additional context
- Use code blocks or quotes when relevant
- Keep sections focused and concise

## Language
- Prefer active voice
- NEVER use contractions
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define technical terms when used
- Keep sentences crisp and direct
