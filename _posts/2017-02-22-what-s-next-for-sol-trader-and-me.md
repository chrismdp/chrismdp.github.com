I've been rather too silent in the last couple of months about what I've been working on. Here's the low-down:

## Sol Trader 1.3: enhanced gameplay, balance &amp; UI improvements

I've been thinking about how to further improve [Sol Trader](http://soltrader.net), my first indie game released last year. The game hasn't sold that well - you can check the numbers on Steam Spy for yourself. I've [written about this before](/2016/06/5-ways-i-screwed-up-sol-traders-launch-a-postmortem/): in summary I've put the lack of sales down to a crowded space-sim genre and a lack of focused playtesting which gave rise to gameplay and UI that was hard to learn.

Encouragingly, people who do get past the UI tend to love the gameplay, and I'd love to continue to support players by releasing free updates. In particular there are some balance and UI improvements coming, I'm going to bump the number of characters to ensure jobs are filled, and I'd love to sneak in a surprise new gameplay feature...

I'm showing Sol Trader again at [Rezzed](https://www.egx.net/rezzed) at the end of March, so if you want to see a preview of the improvements, stop by and come and play the game! The new major update should be ready in April. You can also [buy Sol Trader on Steam right now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/396680).

## The next game :)

Eventually, I'm best served by moving on to a new project, so I've also been prototyping an exciting new game idea this year. It's based on some of the best ideas in Sol Trader, combining a lot of the innovations with a streamlined gameplay experience that will be easier to get into. I've already got together a name, backstory and setting (it's not a space game) and test gameplay. I'm not quite ready to talk about it publicly yet - I will be soon!

I'm in the process of figuring out funding for the new game, and I'm thinking of running another Kickstarter in March as part of this journey. I loved [being on Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/projects/chrismdp/sol-trader/) last year - the people I met through that community are amazingly supportive and it would be great to ensure that I'm making the game that people want to play.

I'd [love to hear from you](mailto:chris@revelationgames.co) if you have thoughts about funding. I'll also be at GDC next week if you want to chat there.

## Introducing: Revelation Games

I've finally pulled my games development work into my own label: [Revelation Games](http://revelationgames.co). You can follow on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/revelationga) to get the latest updates, or [sign up to the mailing list](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/r/1458D7D6C263FB37).

In summary: I'm excited about what's next and what the next couple of years will bring! What's new with you?
