[Sol Trader](http://soltrader.net)'s release date is set for late April 2016 so we're gearing up for two big shows this year to put the game in the hands of gamers.

We had a great time at EGX in September last year, and are looking forward to returning to [EGX Rezzed](https://www.egx.net/rezzed) on 7-9 April.

We have a big double stand and there will be lots of opportunity to get your hands dirty with a preview build of the final game. You'll be able to create whole new procedural societies to interact with, flying missions, trade goods, shoot down pirates and avoid the wrath of their family members...

If you've got your tickets, we'll see you there. If you haven't [there are still some available](https://www.egx.net/rezzed/tickets).

## Can't wait until April?

If you haven't backed the game yet, you can [buy beta access and play today](http://soltrader.net/back-us). If you've already backed it, you'll have access to the latest beta [over at our forums](http://forums.soltrader.net).
