It's been a long time since I wrote on this blog. Roughly
10% of the world's population wasn't even alive yet [when I last posted]({%
post_url 2017-12-30-a-new-adventure %}) - that's sobering!

I was in my late thirties, now my mid-forties. [Gower Street](https://gower.st)
was a real adventure, as expected - we 5x'ed the team, iterated the product and
weathered the devastating impact COVID-19 had on the global film industry.

I'm now four years into co-founding and building
[Cherrypick](https://cherrypick.co) with
[TFC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfostercarter/). It's a fantastic meal-led
shopping assistant to help people eat better with zero effort. Founding a
venture capital backed company myself has been a huge learning experience. I've
learned much about just-enough tecnology, consumer
startups, company culture, management, raising money and how venture capital
actually works.

Setting up my [user account on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismdp.com)
reminded me about this blog, and awakened some long germinating desires. I'd
love to write more about the new tech I've been building for Cherrypick, and
learn more about AI in public. I'd love to write for my less experienced self.
I've been running technology organisations for 25 years, and scaled a few tech
teams - my experience could be useful to first time CTOs, tech startup
founrders, and lead developers taking their first steps into management.

I used some of the time during COVID writing on a new blog: Delivery Doubled -
some of that content made it to Twitter, and some more will end up here.  I
could have just started again, but it's quite nice to [refer to over old
posts](/all) and to see the journey. It's been long, varied and meandering, and
I've learned so much from everything I've done and everyone I've met.

Here's to the next chapter.
