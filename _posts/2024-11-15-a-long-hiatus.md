It's been a long time since I wrote on this blog. Roughly
10% of the world's population wasn't even alive yet [when I last posted]({%
post_url 2017-12-30-a-new-adventure %}) - that's sobering!

Life has gone on. I was in my late thirties, now my mid-forties. [Gower
Street](https://gower.st) was a real adventure, as expected - we 5x'ed the
team, iterated the product and weathered the devastating impact COVID-19 had on
the global film industry.

I'm now four years into co-founding and building
[Cherrypick](https://cherrypick.co) with
[TFC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfostercarter/). It's a fantastic meal-led
shopping assistant to help people eat better with zero effort. Founding a
venture capital backed company myself has been a huge learning experience.  a
rollercoaster. I've learned much about just-enough tecnology, consumer
startups, company culture, management, raising money and how venture capital
actually works.

I'd love to write more about the new tech I've been building, and learn more
about AI. I've now been running technology organisations for 25 years and my
experience could be useful to up and coming CTOs.

To this end I used some of the time during COVID writing on the Delivery
Doubled site (now defunct) - some of that content made it to Twitter, and some
more will end up here. The content was quite average. Some posts were good,
others quite derivative and not impactful enough. Was a good therapeutic outlet
for me during lockdown though.

I could have just started again, but it's quite nice to [refer to over old
posts](/all) and to see the journey. It's been long and winding, and I've learned
so much.
