It has been a long time since I wrote on this blog. Roughly
10% of the world's population wasn't even alive yet [when I last posted]({%
post_url 2017-12-30-a-new-adventure %}) - that's sobering!

I was in my late thirties, now my mid-forties. My kids were just approaching
their teens - I now have two adult children. [Gower Street](https://gower.st)
was a real adventure, as expected - we 5x'ed the team, iterated the product and
weathered the devastating impact COVID-19 had on the global film industry.

I'm now four years into co-founding and building
[Cherrypick](https://cherrypick.co) with
[TFC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfostercarter/). (It is a fantastic meal-led
shopping assistant to help people eat better with zero effort - you should try
it!) Founding a venture capital backed company myself has been a huge learning
experience. I have learned much about just-enough tecnology, consumer startups,
company culture, management, raising money and how venture capital actually
works.

Setting up my [user account on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismdp.com)
reminded me about this blog, and awakened a latent desire to write again. I'd
love to say more about the new tech I have been building for Cherrypick, and
write more about the new incredible wave of AI innovation that's crashed
through tech in the last few years. I have also been running technology organisations
for 25 years now, and scaled a few tech teams - my experience could be useful
to first time CTOs, tech startup founrders, and lead developers taking their
first steps into management.

I used some of the time during COVID writing on a now-defunct blog called
Delivery Doubled, aimed at helping agile teams ship faster. Some of that
content made it to Twitter, and some more will end up here.  I could have just
started again, but it's quite nice to [look back over old posts](/all) and to
see the journey. It has been long, varied and meandering, and I have learned so
much from everything I have worked on and everyone I have met so far.

Here's to the next chapter.
