Why do this?
------------

I used to print out the Day Keeper from [D\*I\*Y Planner](http://www.douglasjohnston.net/weblog/archives/2005/03/28/diyplanner2/) for my [Hipster PDA](http://www.hipsterpda.com) every day, and fill it in by hand. I was also alternating between printing the cal-tex output of the Emacs Diary and trying to shoehorn that onto the cards, and filling in the Weekly Planners from D\*I\*Y planner.

A few things bothered me about these approaches:

* D\*I\*Y Planner cards aren't formatted in the right shape for an index card, so it always came out a little small when zoomed to fit on an index card (Update: Doug's now fixed this with his excellent [Hipster PDA version](http://www.douglasjohnston.net/templates/hipsterpda.html))
* The pre-printed dates weren't enough for my (very) long day.
* The resolution and contrast wasn't always correct for my laser printer.

So I've created an alternative in SVG. There are a few tweaks, mostly thanks to the increased length a portrait index card gives you - the Day Keeper has a longer day, and the Week Plan has space for more entries
The nice thing about doing it in SVG is that anyone with a copy of [Batik](http://xml.apache.org/batik/) can easily roll out PNGs for whatever resolution their printer supports, and it's very easy to edit and tweak for your own use. Feel free to do so; please send any useful mods so I can roll the best ones into this version
