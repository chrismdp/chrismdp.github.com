Most developers have tried AI coding assistants. Few use them effectively. There is a vast gap between impressive demos and production reality. Your AI is wrong 70 percent of the time, and that is actually fine.

I am speaking at [AI for the Rest of Us London 2025](https://aifortherestofus.live/london-2025) about mastering AI coding tools for real production work. No vibe coding. No magic demos. Just practical techniques that work.

## The Production Reality

At [Cherrypick](https://cherrypick.co), we ship AI-assisted code daily to tens of thousands of users. Every bug matters. We have discovered what works through thousands of hours of real production development.

The "reset and refine" approach outperforms continuous iteration. Repository-specific rules prevent repeated mistakes. Documentation becomes a collaboration tool between humans and AI. These techniques transform AI from a frustrating autocomplete into a genuine productivity multiplier.

## Beyond Basic Autocomplete

Most teams use AI as slightly smarter autocomplete. They miss the real power. The journey progresses through distinct stages. Context-aware suggestions that understand your codebase. Prompt stacking for complex tasks. Autonomous agents that handle entire features.

Each stage requires different mental models and guardrails. Traditional development techniques fail with AI collaboration. New cognitive strategies prevent overwhelm while maintaining code quality.

## What You Will Learn

This talk delivers immediate, actionable techniques. You will understand why AI mistakes are acceptable and how to manage them. You will learn context management that prevents confusion. You will discover how to progress from autocomplete to autonomous agents.

More importantly, you will gain the mental models for effective AI collaboration. The guardrails that ensure production-ready code. The documentation approaches that transform vague requirements into focused assistance.

[AI for the Rest of Us](https://aifortherestofus.live) brings together practitioners shipping real code to real users. Join me on 15 October 2025 to move beyond the hype and master AI coding tools for real production work.
