There are way too many AI tools out there now. Every week brings another dozen "revolutionary" AI products promising to transform how you work. It's overwhelming trying to figure out what's actually useful versus what's just hype.

**So I've put together this major comparison of all the major AI tools as of May 2025.** No fluff, no marketing speak - just a straightforward look at what each tool actually does and who it's best for. Whether you're looking for coding help, content creation, or just want to chat with an AI, this should help you cut through the noise and find what you need.

I'll keep this up to date as new tools emerge and existing ones evolve. If you spot any errors please let me know on social media!

### Key

- ðŸ’° - Paid plan needed ($10-30/month)
- ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° - Premium plan needed ($100+/month)

## Search, Chat & Discovery

While all major AI models now offer similar core capabilities, each has its own strengths. I personally use Google's tools for deep research and analysis, and OpenAI for search and conversational AI. I have found Claude to be too limiting for daily use without a premium plan.

## Coding

For coding, I still find Cursor to be the best overall solution. While Jules shows promise, AI coding agents still have a way to go before they are truly reliable. The choice between CLI and IDE-based tools comes down to personal preference. Cloud builders are amazing for rapid prototyping, but for real production code I stick with Cursor's more robust development environment.

## Creation and Productivity

For writing and design work, I primarily use Claude through Cursor as it offers the best results. [Adam Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-martin-b3ba4414a/) recently published an [excellent evaluation of Google's Stitch](https://fractional-ctos.com/2025/05/24/google-stitch-evaluation-alternatives/) that's worth checking out. While AI creation tools are currently expensive, the emerging prototypes in this space will revolutionise content creation across all media formats once they're production-ready.

## Building Agents

Tools for building AI agents remain in their early stages, with significant room for improvement across all platforms. Evaluations in particular remain problematic - I have been developing [Kaijo](https://kaijo.ai) as my own solution in this space (see my [announcement](/kaijo) for details). For orchestration, I find [n8n](https://n8n.io) particularly useful for no-code automation workflows, though it is quite technical - if you are looking for something more user-friendly, [Zapier](https://zapier.com) might be a better choice.
