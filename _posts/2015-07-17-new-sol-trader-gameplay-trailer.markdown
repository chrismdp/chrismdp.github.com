Over the last three weeks, I completely removed all traces of our old GUI code and wrote a fresh GUI from scratch. I also entirely reskinned the GUI to the final look and feel of the game.

It's been a huge amount of hard work, but I'm very proud of the result. I'll talk more about the reasons for replacing the GUI soon, but in the meantime, here's a gameplay trailer showing a short section of the new GUI in action!

In between travelling through space you'll be spending some time hanging out in cities, hiring ships, taking loans and interacting with the citizens who live there. The trailer shows you playing a character called Harry with a wife and family, who heads to the bank to take a loan. What do you think?
