Welcome to my new github blog. This blog will contain wonderful insightful witty comment on many things, such as business, code, crafting and life.

It's likely to stay fairly technical (this is a github page after all), and include updates from the mentoring of the awesome developers I'm currently mentoring, [James Hunt](http://ohthatjames.github.com) and [Richard Patching](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/blogs/richard).

Do [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ChrisParsons) if you want to be kept up to date.
