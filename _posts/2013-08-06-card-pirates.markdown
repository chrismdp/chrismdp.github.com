I made a little game this week called [Card Pirates](http://cardpirates.com). It's a fun thematic pirate card game for 2 - 4 players. Players take the role of an old fashioned pirate ship on the high seas, searching for treasure, avoiding storms, attacking other ships and attempting to win the favour of the island governors.

It can be learned very quickly, and is great fun to play. You can win if you're lucky, but there's a lot of strategy too. It takes about 20 - 40 minutes to play.

The game is playable with **just one pack of playing cards and a token to represent each player,** so there's no excuse not to give it a go! We started with lego bricks and have moved on to little plastic ships from another game.

Try it out and let me know what you think, either here or on the [Card Pirates](http://cardpirates.com/stories) site. I'd be grateful for feedback!
