Since getting the [new mission code into Sol Trader](/2015/12/the-christmas-eve-update-with-moddable-missions/) before Christmas, I've been working on upgrading the conversation mode. Now it's possible to have much more detailed conversations with players about your events and theirs:

![deep conversation](http://i.imgur.com/rjcMlVr.png)

Conversations get 'deeper' the more you share, so you can feed a character lots of interesting (and potentially damaging) information about your life, and in return you'll get equally sensitive information back about the character you're talking to.

If you're talking about a different character, then you can share what you know about them and get information back in return. This way you can build up pictures of characters you know about by gradually discovering information about their past.

The flipside is that you're sharing sensitive information about yourself, which could potentially be used against you by other characters in the future. It'll soon be possible for characters to blackmail you by forcing you to undertake a mission by a certain time, or they'll release damaging information about you. Be careful who you give your sensitive information to!

This build is now available [on the forums](http://forums.soltrader.net) should you have access ([there's still time if you don't](http://soltrader.net/back-us).)
