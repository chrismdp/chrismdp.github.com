I facilitated a workshop at [SC2011](http://lanyrd.com/2011/software-craftsmanship/) today about how code might be thought of as Lean. The idea was to start a coding project and cope with shifting requirements to identify what happens when we deliver as fast as we can, whether testing is worth it, and what waste actually means.

If you were there, please do [rate the talk](http://speakerrate.com/talks/7643-lean-code) so I can improve!

A number of people expressed an interest in trying the exercise, so here are the slides if you're interested in trying it at home.

The session details are also [on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/software-craftsmanship/sfkgw/).

Let me know how you get on, and if you need any help!
