Rebranding a successful mobile app is like performing heart surgery while the patient runs a marathon. One wrong move risks destroying everything you have built.

Yet sometimes you must do it anyway.

I will share what I have learned about changing your app's identity without losing your users in the process.

## The challenge of rebranding

Changing your app's name extends far beyond updating a few strings. The name users see on their phones represents only the beginning. Your App Store presence demands a complete refresh - from screenshots to descriptions. The visual identity needs reimagining, from color palette to iconography. Customer support channels require careful updates. Backend systems and APIs need consideration. Marketing materials and social presence demand synchronized changes.

Each element presents its own risks. The stakes rise exponentially when you have an established user base who knows and trusts your current brand. [Your abstractions are a liability](/your-abstractions-are-a-liability), and your brand represents one of your most critical abstractions.

## A real-world success story

I recently spoke with a team who successfully rebranded their popular UK app from "Lollipop" to "Cherrypick". Their experience offers valuable lessons in approaching this challenge.

The key to their success? They treated it as a major engineering project, not just a marketing exercise. Much like how [keeping the build passing](/cucumber-keeping-the-build-passing) requires constant attention, they maintained a relentless focus on stability throughout the transition.

## The three pillars of safe rebranding

### 1. Minimize technical risk

The team made a crucial early decision: they would change the brand without changing the app's technical identifier. This detail, though seemingly small, dramatically reduced the technical complexity of the transition.

They also delayed changing technical infrastructure like API domains and email systems. Some of these still run under the old brand name over a year later - and that works perfectly fine. As with any large technical change, attempting everything at once multiplies risk unnecessarily.[^1]

### 2. Test extensively behind feature flags

Instead of building the new brand in a separate branch and hoping it would work, they built it incrementally within their existing app. They started with a hidden settings menu option that showed a "storybook" of new brand components. This evolved into a complete "app within an app" using the new brand.

Staff received encouragement to use the new version, creating a pool of early testers. When they found issues, the team could fix them without rushing. By the time they prepared for the switch, the new brand had already run in production for months.

### 3. Plan the transition carefully

The team developed a comprehensive transition strategy. They chose their quietest period - two weeks before Christmas - for the switch. A three-month communications campaign preceded the change, featuring social teasers and customer feedback. They surveyed their best users about name candidates.

They obtained App Store review approval early to avoid last-minute surprises. The store listing kept a "formerly Lollipop" tag for a month. The team actively monitored and responded to user reviews throughout the process.

## The power of reversibility

The most important aspect of their approach centered on building in the ability to reverse course. If something had gone wrong on switchover day, they could have reverted everyone to the old brand through their feature flag system.

This safety net enabled them to proceed with confidence, knowing they had a way out if needed. Much like how [continuous deployment](/sol-trader-continuous-deployment) requires the ability to roll back changes quickly, they ensured they could undo any problematic changes.

## Results

After all the planning and preparation, the actual transition proved almost anticlimactic - exactly what you want in a high-stakes technical change. Users found their app, the new brand worked as expected, and business continued as usual.

## Lessons for your own rebranding

When planning to rebrand your mobile app, focus on these key principles:

### Separate identity from infrastructure
Change your brand first, technical systems later. This separation of concerns reduces complexity and risk.

### Build and test in production
Use feature flags to develop and validate the new brand alongside the old one. This provides real-world validation before full deployment.

### Plan for failure
Always maintain a way to revert changes. This safety net enables confident progress.

### Communicate clearly
Help users understand what is happening and why. Clear communication prevents confusion and maintains trust.

### Choose timing carefully
Pick a quiet period when you can afford some disruption. This provides space to address any issues that arise.

## Beyond rebranding

These principles apply to any major user-facing change in your app. Incremental development behind feature flags, extensive testing in production, clear communication, careful timing, and reversibility form the foundations of safe change in any critical system.[^2]

Remember: your users do not care about your rebrand. They care about using your app to solve their problems. Your job is to help them transition so smoothly that they barely notice anything has changed.

That defines success.
