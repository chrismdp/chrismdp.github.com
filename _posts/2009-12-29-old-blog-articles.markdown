I've spent the evening importing some old articles from my past blogging days, so they're all in one place. By all means peruse the following pieces of history:

* [The Spring: Richclient series](/2006/04/spring-richclient)
* [SVG Planner Index cards](/2006/10/svg-planner)
* [TDD: Tortoise and the the Hare](/2006/02/tdd-the-tortoise-and-the-hare)

I'm moving servers and these would have previously vanished from the net. They still get plenty of traffic so it makes sense to keep them around for posterity. Drop me a line if you find them interesting!
