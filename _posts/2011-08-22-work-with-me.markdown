I've been taking a break from my work and blogging for the summer: but now I'm looking for work again from next week.

To this end I've put up a [new page](/workwithme.html) on this site which has all the details of what I can offer, and my availability. If you'd like to work with me this autumn, do [get in touch](mailto:chris@thinkcodelearn.com).

I also plan to start blogging again soon, with my first topic being how we handled the massive site traffic we experienced on e-petitions [a couple of weeks ago](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14474429).
