The sixth of June is a significant day for me personally. In 2004, I spent the entire of the day in hospital. I remember the 60th anniversary commemorations of D-day on the TV in the background, as I sat beside my wife, in labour with our first child. I became a father an hour after midnight on the 7th June; my son becomes a teenager tomorrow.

Twelve years later, in 2016, I spent the entire of 6th June glued to [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/396680) watching and waiting whilst my first game [Sol Trader](http://store.steampowered.com/app/396680/Sol_Trader/) was released to the world. This was a career dream come true: since I started programming at six years old I'd always wanted to create and ship my own games. Sol Trader's release was ultimately a painfully formative experience for me, which [I wrote about at the time](http://chrismdp.com/2016/06/5-ways-i-screwed-up-sol-traders-launch-a-postmortem/) and [was interviewed about recently in GamesIndustry.biz.](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-06-05-i-was-completely-unprepared-for-releasing-a-game-in-the-modern-marketplace)

Over the last year, I've been keeping busy doing two things. One is to support Sol Trader as much as I can with countless updates and patches. I've also been very busy working on a new game, <a href='http://ealdorlight.com'>Ealdorlight</a>, a medieval RPG-style take on Sol Trader's mechanics, with turn-based combat, realistic damage and great graphics. [I announced Ealdorlight in March](http://chrismdp.com/2017/03/introducing-ealdorlight/) and demonstrated it at Rezzed, strengthening my hope that the idea was a good one.

I decided fairly early on that I wanted to take Ealdorlight to Kickstarter. Sol Trader's successful Kickstarter was a brilliant experience. The Kickstarter community is one of the kindest, most positive on the Internet. I also needed funding for this game: Sol Trader was self-funded through many long evenings and contracting work, and for Ealdorlight I need a bigger team to realise the vision. It's built in Unreal Engine 4, which simultaneously saves me loads of development time and means I need a bigger team to pull off the realistic art style I've gone for.

As time came near to launch, the first anniversary of Sol Trader's released seemed an appropriate day to launch the campaign. So today, 6th June 2017, I will spend the entire day glued to Kickstarter as my [campaign goes live](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chrismdp/460088710?token=b18de00d) at 4pm today.

There's plenty more about Ealdorlight on the campaign - head over there and read all about it! A huge amount of work has gone into it, and I'm very grateful for all the support and help I've received from the team I've put together, and for friends and family who have given me endless encouragements and feedback.

_This post is a little earlier than 4pm so that you can watch it go live if you want. Earlier backers get lower edition numberings on some of the rewards, so you might want to be there from the start!_
