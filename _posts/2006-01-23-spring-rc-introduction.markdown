<p>Right, time to learn Spring Rich Client.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to learn this project for a while, but haven't yet quite got round to it. Now is the time. A client wants a piece of work done that see
ms very well suited to using this framework, and it's an ideal time to work it all out.</p>
<p>Initial viewing of the project shows that there's very little in the way of documentation for the project (well, none, actually), so I'm going to attempt
 to document my documentation-less journey into the depths of the framework. When I look back, a sort of tutorial may even have emerged, which might help others. You never know.</p>
<p>If you notice that I'm doing this or that wrong, please feel free to post a comment and correct me. I don't care about looking amateurish or anything lik
e that, and it'll turn this into a better reference.</p>
<p>Coming soon: "Session One: Making Petclinic work"</p>
