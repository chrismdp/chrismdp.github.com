I posted a warning on LinkedIn last week: Claude Code works on your phone via Termius. You won't be able to stop using it.

The replies confirmed what I suspected. People are coding from everywhere now. Sofas. Cafes. The school run. One person admitted to fixing a bug while waiting for a haircut.

This is either the future of work or the end of any remaining work-life boundaries. Possibly both.

## The Setup

[Termius](https://termius.com/){:target="_blank"} is an SSH client that runs on iOS and Android. It connects to any machine running SSH. Claude Code runs in a terminal. Put these together and you have a fully functional AI coding environment in your pocket.

The setup takes five minutes:

1. Install Termius on your phone
2. Add your development machine as a host (IP address, SSH key or password)
3. Connect and run `claude`
4. Start coding

That's it. No special configuration. No mobile-specific tooling. Just SSH into your machine and Claude Code works exactly as it does on desktop.

## Why This Changes Things

I've tried mobile coding before. Every attempt failed for the same reason: typing code on a phone is miserable. Brackets, semicolons, precise indentation - all painful on a touchscreen.

Claude Code inverts this. You're not typing code. You're having a conversation about code. Natural language works fine on a phone keyboard. Even better with voice dictation.

"Add error handling to the checkout flow" is easy to type on a phone. The equivalent code changes are not. Claude handles the translation.

## The Warning

Here's what I didn't expect: the friction that kept me from working everywhere was also protecting my downtime.

When coding required a laptop, I had natural boundaries. Can't code on the train - no laptop. Can't code waiting for the kids - too awkward. Can't code in bed - well, I could, but it felt excessive.

Now I can. Every spare moment becomes a potential coding session. The queue at the coffee shop. The five minutes before a meeting. The gap between putting kids to bed and dinner being ready.

Is this good? The productivity gains are real. Small tasks that would have waited until "back at the desk" get done immediately. Context stays fresh. Momentum continues.

But the ability to work anywhere is also the inability to be anywhere without the option of work. The boundary between "could work" and "should rest" gets blurry.

## What I Actually Use It For

After a few weeks, I've settled into patterns:

**Quick fixes**: Typos, small bugs, config changes. Things that would nag at me until I got back to a proper computer. Now I just fix them.

**Code review**: Reading diffs and discussing changes with Claude works surprisingly well on mobile. No typing code, just reading and commenting.

**Planning**: Describing what I want to build, having Claude sketch out approaches, thinking through architecture. The conversation-first nature suits mobile perfectly.

**Emergencies**: Production issues don't wait for convenient timing. Being able to investigate and potentially fix problems from anywhere is genuinely valuable.

What I don't use it for: Writing substantial new features, complex refactoring, anything requiring careful visual inspection of code. The screen is too small and the context too fragmented.

## The Honest Assessment

Mobile Claude Code is a tool that makes certain things easier and makes overwork more convenient. Whether that's net positive depends entirely on your discipline.

For me, the ability to clear small tasks from anywhere reduces the mental load of "things I need to remember to do later." That's worth something.

But I've also had to set explicit rules: no coding after 9pm, no coding during family activities, no coding just because I could. The tool doesn't enforce boundaries. I have to.

If you struggle with work-life separation, this might make things worse. If you're good at boundaries but frustrated by the friction of context-switching back to work, this might be exactly what you need.

Try it. But don't say I didn't warn you.
