AI is no longer a passing trend. It is shaping the future of technology and leadership. Whether you are sceptical of the hype or convinced it is essential to your strategy, one thing is clear: avoiding the conversation is not an option.

<!--more-->

CTO Craft are running a half-day AI Leadership Lab the day before their main conference. I am one of several leaders running workshops.

## My Session: Advanced Prompting

I will be running my most popular workshop: Advanced Prompting. This is the hands-on, practical session where you stop getting AI to give you the answers and start getting it to give you the questions.

Attendees consistently have epiphany moments during this workshop. You will think differently about how you approach your work and how AI can help you. Bring your laptop and your favourite chat system.

## The Wider Programme

Roll up your sleeves with peers and dive into topics like:

**Cybersecurity in the age of AI.** How to sound like you know what you are talking about, and actually know it.

**Building an AI Guild within your organisation.** Creating the internal structures that drive adoption.

**Partnering with your exec team to set realistic expectations.** Bridging the gap between AI hype and AI reality.

**Psychological safety in the face of AI.** Friend or foe? How to lead teams through uncertainty.

**How AI will reshape teams, skills, and the future of engineering.** What leaders need to prepare for now.

Whether you are taking baby steps or bold leaps, AI is already here. This is your chance to explore it with fellow leaders in a space that is honest, practical, and forward-looking.

Spaces are strictly limited. Secure your place early.
