<p><b>Note:</b> This approach works best when starting off a brand new feature in the system. When changing existing features, we need to work to keep our preamble up to date. <a href='http://blog.mattwynne.net/2010/10/22/features-user-stories/'>Matt Wynne's blog post</a> shows you how.</p>

<p>If you like what you see, and you'd like to learn more, a quick reminder that Matt and I are running <a href='http://bddkickstart.com'>BDD Kickstart</a> in London this coming December: the early bird ends November 4th.
