As someone who lives an hour and a half from my London office, I love working from home.  I can help my teenagers out of the door in the morning, and I am present when the family comes home.  I can have coffee with my wife Ellie before we start work.  I prepare dinner during my lunch break, and receive deliveries.  I can contribute more effort during my day to Cherrypick, free from distractions, interruptions and the long commute. I would struggle to work effectively five days a week in London.

I also love working from the office. It is an opportunity to spend real time with the people I work with. Communication is easier and I spend less time on screens. I can train less experienced colleagues much more efficiently than video chat. I can ask for and give advice and help in person, cutting down long feedback cycles. I would struggle to work effectively five days a week from home.

Much of the debate around hybrid working appears to be a zero sum argument about why working from home is "better" or "worse", and why working in the office is "more" or "less" productive.

One is not better than the other; they are just different. I think we need both[^both] for a balanced life.

Here are some pointers for how to have a productive conversation about hybrid in your team.

## Be honest

Companies struggle to communicate well about hybrid, which causes bad feeling amongst their team.

Plenty of organisations say staff do not need to be in the office, but they have a culture that insists upon it because it is the only way to get support or be noticed.

Other organisations insist on their team being in the office a set number of days, but do not help coordinate this so that it is actually productive. The team is not sure why this is important, only that they have to be there.

Worse, senior team members make decisions about how often their team must be in the office, but play by different rules themselves and spend more time at home than they allow their team. They see the benefits to home working but do not allow others the freedom to make good decisions for themselves or the company.

Be honest. If it is an office job, call it an office job. Five days a week in the office is fine, if the expectation is clear and everyone willingly agrees. If you are advertising a hybrid job, talk about how this will work so expectations are clear. Play by the same rules that you make for your team.

## Have a values based discussion

There are often implicit assumptions on both sides of the hybrid debate. Managers can assume that their team wish to do the minimum, or will not be able to be productive from home. Team members can assume the request to be in the office is caused by a lack of trust in their commitment or ability to set their own working practice.

The cause is a lack of shared understanding of values between the senior team making the decisions, and the team that has to live them out.

There needs to be an honest conversation on the values behind the decisions being made, so there is clarity about what needs to be done. Talk to the team about the benefits of being together. Ask them how they feel about it, and what their assumptions are. Listen hard and make allowances for different temperaments.[^safety]

There is not one set formula for hybrid success. I work from London one or two days a week, pre-agreed with my team. I make sure I am only there when there is a good reason. It will be different for every team and company.

Few would disagree that coming together to work from time to time is valuable and useful. It is great for morale and for collaboration. People do not want to be forced by a blanket rule they do not understand, where the rationale is not clear.

## Make office days worth the effort

At Cherrypick, office days are special. We ensure that everyone is in the office on the same days, but are flexible if people cannot manage it for whatever reason. We sit and have lunch together. We spend more time discussing nuanced topics.

We go for walks along the river to [St Paul's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral) and back, discussing tricky topics or issues. I have spent several 1:1s wandering through the [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern), chatting to people about their lives, their work and their hopes for the future.

We make allowances for journey times and are flexible with when people arrive and leave.  We pay for travel to get to the London area, so cost does not prevent people coming in. (To be fair to London-based team members, everyone pays for travel within London.)

## Come work with me

If this resonates, [we are hiring a full stack engineer](https://apply.workable.com/cherrypick/j/02F9AE6F1D/). You'll be in London ~2 days a week to get all the benefits of being together, and completely trusted to work from home the rest of the time. Get in touch today.

[^both]: I am a mild extravert, so I gain energy both from being with people and from recharging on my own at different times. Everyone is different. Some will prefer more home working and others will prefer to always be in the office. Having a flexible combination of both office and home work will work for most people and situations, but the exact balance will depend on the work, the life stage and the temperament of the people in the team.

[^safety]: These conversations cannot work unless there is safety in the team first. It is unlikely that hybrid working will be successful in a team where people are not able to speak their minds. If this is the case then you have bigger problems to solve first.
