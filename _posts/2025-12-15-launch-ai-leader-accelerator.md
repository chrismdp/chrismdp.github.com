I have been working on something new for the past few months, and it is ready to launch.

The [AI Leader Accelerator](/ai-leader-accelerator/) is an eight week peer learning programme for senior technical leaders managing AI adoption. It starts on 19th January 2026.

Over the past year, I have had dozens of conversations with CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and Heads of Technology about AI. The same pattern keeps emerging.

They are personally experimenting with AI tools. Some are getting genuinely transformative results. But they have nobody at their level to test their thinking against. The consultants selling AI solutions have never had to roll out change to a real engineering team with real constraints. The courses available teach tools, not how to lead organisational change.

One CTO told me: "Everyone is doing cool stuff with AI, and I have no one to talk to about it." A Head of Engineering said: "I often find it difficult to share ideas with people because there is nobody else really in the same situation."

There is plenty out there for individual contributors wanting to learn AI coding tools. There is very little for the leaders who have to make strategic decisions about how their organisations adopt AI.

## What Makes This Different

The AI Leader Accelerator is built around peer learning with expert facilitation. You are surrounded by CTOs and senior technical leaders solving the same problems as you. The value comes from testing your thinking against people who understand your pressures.

The structure is three hours per week online:

**Monday afternoon**: A taught session with frameworks and provocations on that week's topic.

**Weekly clinic**: A small group session (maximum 8 people) to work through your specific blockers. These are carefully curated so you are grouped with people solving similar problems, and we ensure no direct competitors share a clinic so you can speak freely.

**Thursday afternoon**: Time to ask questions, hold each other accountable, and celebrate wins.

The relationships continue long after the eight weeks end. Pioneer members become founding members of a network that grows with each cohort.

## The Syllabus

We cover the full range of what technical leaders need to know:

**Week 1: The AI Landscape.** AI is a field, not a single tool. We map where your organisation actually is compared to peers and the wider industry.

**Week 2: Level Up Your Own AI Use.** What separates those getting transformative results from those scratching the surface. Using AI specifically for senior technical strategy work.

**Week 3: Leading Multi-Speed Change with High Uncertainty.** Your people are at wildly different stages, and some are actively resistant. How to build momentum when people are moving at different speeds.

**Week 4: Compliance, Privacy, and Security.** The questions your board and team will ask, and how to answer them with confidence.

**Week 5: Using Advanced Agents for Strategic Thinking.** How agents differ from chat interfaces. Building a knowledge base your AI can draw on anytime.

**Week 6: How to Oversee AI in Products.** Strategic constraints and important decisions when building AI into products and internal tools.

**Week 7: Organising Teams for AI Speed.** How to structure and organise your teams when AI accelerates individual productivity.

**Week 8: Planning for the Future.** What is coming next in AI and how to keep your strategy current as the field evolves.

## Pioneer Pricing

This is the first cohort. You help shape the format in exchange for pioneer pricing at up to 44% off the future price, plus lifetime access to future cohort materials and community.

Spaces are limited. I want this to feel small and intimate, where everyone gets personal attention.
