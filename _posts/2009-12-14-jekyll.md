May I mention how cool [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is? I achieved the following:

* Forked a whole blog (yes, a whole blog, git is great too) from [James](http://github.com/ohthatjames/ohthatjames.github.com).
* Vimmed and ackked my way through, changing all James' references to my own
* Wrote my first post
* Set up feedburner to point to the correct blog
* Aggregated my blog feed on our new [staff blogs feed](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/blogs/).
* Set up Disqus for commenting

But how long, how long, I hear you ask? _Twenty minutes_, that's how long. Previously I spent about _three hours_ fiddling around with drupal to set up my last blog. The joys of simple tools, doing one thing stupidly well.
