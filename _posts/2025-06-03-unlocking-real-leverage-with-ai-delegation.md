Starting to delegate to AI feels awkward. It is a lot like hiring your first contractor: you know there is leverage on the other side, but the first steps are messy and uncertain. The myth of the perfect plan holds many people back, but the reality is you just need to begin.

The payoff is real, but the start is always a little rough.

Here is how I do it.

## Why AI Delegation Feels Awkward

The first time I tried delegating to an AI agent, it felt exactly like onboarding a new team member. I was not sure what to hand over or how to check the work. The results were messy and there was a lot of copy/pasting. It took a lot longer than doing it myself.

Delegation is always awkward at the start, whether you are working with people or machines. The learning curve is part of the process, and the discomfort is a sign you are moving forward.

Here are five principles for getting started:

### Start Small
Begin with a simple, concrete task. Even if it feels trivial, this gives you a clear baseline. The first attempt will be clumsy - that is normal. Each iteration helps you refine your instructions and identify potential issues.

### Expect to Iterate
The journey to effective AI delegation is not linear. Each round improves your ability to specify requirements and spot problems. Do not expect perfection on the first try. Instead, focus on learning from each attempt.

### Use Human Delegation Frameworks
Apply the same frameworks you use for human delegation. The VSEM framework helps separate vision, strategy, and execution. A GTD approach breaks work into manageable chunks. I wrote more about how to apply these delegation frameworks in AI coding in [this post](/livestream-23rd-may-2025-complex-change/).

### Treat it Like Hiring Contractors
Approach AI delegation like hiring contractors: experiment quickly and move on if something is not working. Do not get stuck trying to make a suboptimal approach work. The goal is to find what works for you.

### Embrace the Mess

The path to effective AI delegation is not smooth. It is fiddly and sometimes frustrating. But every experiment brings you closer to real leverage. The mess is part of the process - embrace it and keep moving forward.

## How to Delegate a Workflow

### Start with a Fixed Task

Begin with something entirely fixed, without AI, to get used to the tools you have available.

For example, I use n8n to automate a Kit tag addition that creates a Google Calendar entry for [my webinars](/webinar). It was fiddly to create, but it helped me learn how the workflow tool worked.

If you are more technical, try using n8n. If you are not, Zapier is a great place to start. There are plenty more [tools out there](/ai-tools-list/) if you need more options.

### Look for Decision Points

Once you are comfortable with the tools, look for decision points in your workflow where you would not normally give the job to a computer. Try and find a really simple decision that you make all the time.

If you are not sure what an AI might be able to do, ask an AI agent to brainstorm where an agent could help within your workflow. This kind of meta-thinking about strategy is a really important skill to develop in the age of AI.

### Automate One Thing

Pick a small decision to automate. Set up the automation in your chosen tool. Add an AI agent to handle the decision point. Test, iterate, and refine.

Each experiment will teach you something new about the tool and what AI can do, slowly increasing your leverage over time.

If something doesn't work, revisit when a new model comes out. Those who will be at the forefront of this will be the ones who are willing to go back and push the boundaries again, and experiment and learn. The tech is moving so fast that what didn't work three months ago might just work now, unlocking big productivity gains.

### An Example

Here is an example. Imagine you receive inbound emails asking for advice. You probably already automate parts of this process, using rules, by marking particular emails as important based on who they are from. Try first to move this process to a workflow tool. (Note: this could get expensive if you get a lot of email, so perhaps do the first pass of filtering via your existing email rules, such as emails not directly addressed to you.)

Once that's done, how do you process the rest? Normally, you might read each one and decide: should you reply personally, refer the person to a resource, or have AI draft a first response?

This is a perfect decision point to automate. Set up a workflow where AI reviews the email and drafts a reply for you to approve, or marks the email as important for your attention. You can start by automating the triage step, then gradually hand over more of the process as you gain confidence.

## The Payoff and Next Steps

Delegating is always awkward. It could be the job is done only 80% as well as if you did it. But if we learn to delegate and let go of our perfectionism, real leverage opens us for us. The beauty of the AI age is that this leverage is beginning to be available to all, not just high performing leaders. We need to learn the skills they use to delegate to realise the same benefits.

The awkwardness is a sign you are learning and making progress. Every experiment brings you closer to the kind of leverage that transforms your workflow. You do not need a perfect system; you just need to start. Share your experiences, keep experimenting, and watch as the payoff grows.
