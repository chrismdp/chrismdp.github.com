_"A great mentor for me... Chris is very experienced both in the technical side of setting up a well functioning tech team, but also in the business side, possessing a keen eye for strategy and a good sense for what will and will not work in any given environment. If you're a startup looking for someone to help build a great team, or you need someone experienced to help develop a sound tech strategy, I would thoroughly recommend Chris."_

_"Chris has clearly learned a *lot* about the world of being a delivery-focused CTO, he has a very clear understanding of the need for pragmatic planning, knowledge sharing, team up-skilling and the paying down of technical debt... I hope to continue to learn from Chris' experience."_

_"Chris is fantastic at building self-sufficient teams and giving them what they need to deliver impactful product changes and experiments. He provides a lot of freedom while setting clear goals, which creates highly productive teams in early-stage startups. At the same time, heâ€™s an empathetic leader who always keeps a pulse on team morale. This is an extremely punchy combo when it comes to pre-product-market-fit companies, where hyper focus, productivity and seeding the right company culture are key."_

I have led 5 startups over 20 years:
- I cofounded 4, and was an early CTO at one
- 3 were bootstrapped, 1 backed by super angel + 1 by VC
- 3 were B2C, 2 were B2B
- 1 was an agency, 4 were product companies
- I scaled teams to 5, 12, 25 & 50

I have been through a wide variety of startup experiences multiple times. I can help you hire great technical teams, [set culture](/how-to-avoid-bad-startup-culture), find product market fit and build [just enough tech](/the-job-is-not-to-build). I've also got several years of experience working on AI products so can help you [build robust LLM application](/how-to-build-a-robust-llm-application) that scales well and that your customers love.

## Why Founders and CTOs Need a Coach

Coaching helps founders and CTOs grow and achieve their goals. A startup has high stakes and huge potential value so getting support makes a real difference to the chances of success. I have benefited from a number of excellent coaches and mentors over the years, and my startup experience has been vastly better and less stressful thanks to them.

Technical leadership faces evolving challenges at every stage:
- Making strategic architectural decisions that align with business goals
- Building and scaling high-performing engineering teams
- Balancing high-level strategy with hands-on leadership
- Staying current with emerging technologies like AI/LLM
- Maintaining velocity while ensuring technical quality

Having someone in the CTO's corner who has been through these challenges before, as I have at multiple startups, helps transform uncertainty into confident progress.

## Coaching vs Mentoring

I am part coach, part mentor.

Coaching is a conversation to move you from where you are now, to where you would like to be. You get independent assistance to help you move forward without any judgement or anyone telling you what to do. You find your own answers and are then supported while you make changes.

Mentoring is benefiting from past experience, knowledge and mistakes to help you make better decisions. You can be coached by a non-expert, but a mentor can provide lots of extra value as they have been in your position before.

A founder or CTO benefits from a coach but working with someone who has been through the same challenges before is much more valuable. I have walked this journey through several startups over 20 years and can help you avoid plenty of mistakes and find a way through the maze of uncertainty.
