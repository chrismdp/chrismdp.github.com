**You have raised funding. You have got some developers. You want to move fast: but the tech is messy, the product is fuzzy, and everything is feels like it is on fire.**

That’s where I come in.

I help founders scale *without* burning cash, build tech teams that actually ship, and make product decisions that don’t backfire.  
You do not need a full-time CTO yet, but you *do* need someone who has done this before) and knows where the landmines are.

### I’ll help you:

- Build and lead high-performing product & engineering teams  
- Avoid expensive architectural dead ends

- Cut costs without slowing down  
- Land key customers with credible pre-sales support  
- Raise with confidence: I have sat on both sides of the table 

This is not hands-off consulting. I have [25 years of experience](/) running tech teams and founding startups. I roll up my sleeves, build team, own outcomes, and help you make the right calls, and fast.
