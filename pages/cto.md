_"Chris is very experienced both in the technical side of setting up a well functioning tech team, but also in the business side, possessing a keen eye for strategy and a good sense for what will and will not work in any given environment. If you're a startup looking for someone to help build a great team, or you need someone experienced to help develop a sound tech strategy, I would thoroughly recommend Chris."_

_"Chris has clearly learned a *lot* about the world of being a delivery-focused CTO, he has a very clear understanding of the need for pragmatic planning, knowledge sharing, team up-skilling and the paying down of technical debt... I hope to continue to learn from Chris' experience."_

_"Chris is fantastic at building self-sufficient teams and giving them what they need to deliver impactful product changes and experiments. He provides a lot of freedom while setting clear goals, which creates highly productive teams in early-stage startups. At the same time, he's an empathetic leader who always keeps a pulse on team morale. This is an extremely punchy combo."_

## Strategic Advisory Services

I provide comprehensive strategic guidance to help companies understand and optimise their technical capabilities:

- Multi-year technology strategy development
- Technical organisation assessment and optimisation
- Cost reduction through strategic technical planning
- Technology stack evaluation and modernisation
- Team structure and process improvement
- Technical due diligence and risk assessment
- AI and emerging technology adoption strategies

## Why Work With a Fractional CTO?

Early-stage startups often need experienced technical leadership, but may not be ready for a full-time CTO. A fractional CTO provides:

- Strategic technical guidance without the full-time cost
- Expertise in building and scaling teams
- Support during critical growth phases
- Help avoiding common startup pitfalls
- Flexibility to scale up or down as needed

## My Experience
I have [extensive experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisparsons/) working with pre-seed, seed and Series A stage startups in both B2B SaaS and consumer products. I've helped multiple companies:

- Build high-performing engineering teams from scratch
- Implement efficient development processes
- Make strategic technical decisions
- Support successful fundraising rounds
- Move AI prototypes to production
- Find product-market fit

I also offer [technical leadership coaching](/coaching) for startup CTOs and technical leaders who want to level up their skills.

## How I Work
I typically work with companies 1-2 days per week, either fully remote or in the London area. I offer regular weekly engagements, project-based consulting for specific initiatives, and short term strategic advisory engagements.
