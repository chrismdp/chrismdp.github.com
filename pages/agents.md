You have built an AI agent. The demos are impressive. But it is costing you too much, and you never quite know when it will let you down—or do something risky in production.

If you are a CTO, engineering manager, technical founder, or senior engineer, you know that building a demo is easy. Building a reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient agent that your team can trust is another matter entirely. I specialise in helping technical teams turn promising prototypes into robust, production-ready systems.

I have [built and shipped AI agents to production](/how-to-build-a-robust-llm-application/) and created multiple home-grown agent evaluation systems, each one better than the last. I have distilled that learning into [a platform for agent reliability](https://kaijo.ai/?utm_source=chrisdp&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=ai){:target="_blank"}, and I work hands-on with teams to:

- Audit and improve agent reliability, safety, and cost
- Design and implement custom evaluation systems for agents
- Prototype and productionise agent-powered features
- Upskill engineering teams in agent best practices

To get started, take a couple of minutes to answer a few questions:

## For Technical Leaders and Agent Builders

If you are responsible for delivering AI agents that work in the real world, I can help. My services are designed for:

- CTOs and engineering managers who need production-grade agents
- Technical founders and senior engineers scaling agent systems
- Teams struggling with agent reliability, cost, or unpredictable behaviour

You get direct, technical support—no generic advice, no hand-waving. I work with your codebase, your stack, and your real-world constraints.

## Agent-Focused Services

### 1. Agent Reliability Audits

A deep technical review of your agent's architecture, evaluation, and deployment. I identify failure points, cost drivers, and reliability risks, then deliver a prioritised action plan. Includes:

- Code and infra review
- Evaluation of agent behaviour and edge cases
- Recommendations for monitoring, evals, and safety

### 2. Custom Agent Evaluation Systems

Off-the-shelf evals rarely fit real-world agents. I design and implement custom evaluation frameworks so you can measure, monitor, and improve agent performance over time. Deliverables:

- Automated eval pipelines
- Metrics and dashboards tailored to your use case
- Training for your team on running and interpreting evals

### 3. Agent Prototyping & Productionisation

Move from demo to production. I work alongside your engineers to:

- Rapidly prototype new agent features
- Refactor and harden existing agents for scale
- Integrate agents into your product with robust monitoring and cost controls

### 4. Team Workshops & Upskilling

Hands-on, technical workshops for teams building or maintaining agents. Example topics:

- Architecting reliable LLM agents
- Cost optimisation and monitoring
- Debugging and failure analysis in production

If you want to see how I work, request an agent audit or join a workshop. I am happy to share examples of how I have helped teams ship agents that work—at scale, in production, and under real-world constraints.
