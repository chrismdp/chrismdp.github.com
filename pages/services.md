I rebuild momentum, clarity, and confidence across tech organisations that have lost their mojo. I do this through coaching, workshops, and helping the team reshape how they work and think.

## Some of the reasons we should talk

Give me a call if any of these are true for you, or if something else is troubling you with your tech team:

- Your tech costs are out of control
- Process overhead is killing productivity
- You are not confident in your architecture
- Development speed has slowed to a crawl
- You are not sure if you have product/market fit
- Your AI/LLM projects are not getting to production
- You are struggling to hire and retain great engineers
- Your tech team culture is heading in the wrong direction
- The CEO and technical leaders aren't aligned on priorities
- Technical strategy feels disconnected from business goals
- Your tech team is building too much or spending too much doing it

_"Chris has clearly learned a *lot* about the world of being a delivery-focused CTO, he has a very clear understanding of the need for pragmatic planning, knowledge sharing, team up-skilling and the paying down of technical debt... I hope to continue to learn from Chris' experience."_

_"Chris is fantastic at building self-sufficient teams and giving them what they need to deliver impactful product changes and experiments. He provides a lot of freedom while setting clear goals, which creates highly productive teams in early-stage startups. At the same time, he's an empathetic leader who always keeps a pulse on team morale. This is an extremely punchy combo."_
