You must move fast to survive. But the tech is messy, the product is fuzzy, and everything is feels like it is on fire.

That’s where I come in. As a [founder myself](/) I know how it feels to have so much to fix you don't know where to begin, and how you can feel fantastic one day and terrified the next.

I can help you scale *without* burning cash, build tech teams that ship daily, help teams use the latest AI tools effectively, and help you make product decisions that don’t backfire.

## How I work

I start with a 30 minute call to offer free advice and help however I can. From there, I normally suggest a one off audit of your tech strategy and organisation to see where intervention is needed and suggest a concrete plan for improvement. You can then take that further yourself or I can help you implement the plan, through follow up coaching, workshops, process improvements, and more.

If you're already sure what you want, I offer fixed term coaching or retainers to give you peace of mind that you have expert support available when you need it.

_"Chris has clearly learned a *lot* about the world of being a delivery-focused CTO, he has a very clear understanding of the need for pragmatic planning, knowledge sharing, team up-skilling and the paying down of technical debt... I hope to continue to learn from Chris' experience."_
