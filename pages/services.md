You have raised funding. You have got some developers. You want to move fast: but the tech is messy, the product is fuzzy, and everything is feels like it is on fire.

That’s where I come in. As a [fellow founder](/), I know how it feels to have so much to fix you don't know where to begin, and how you can feel fantastic one day and terrified the next.

I can help you scale *without* burning cash, build tech teams that ship daily, and make product decisions that don’t backfire.
