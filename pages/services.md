AI is transforming engineering, but most advice is generic or hype-driven. If you are a CTO, engineering manager, or technical founder, you need more than buzzwords. You need proven, technical solutions that deliver value for your team and your business. You need it now, not in some distant future.

I have spent years as a founder and CTO, building and leading technical teams, shipping production AI systems, and helping others do the same. My approach is direct, technical, and tailored to the realities of engineering leadership. I work with technical leaders who want to:

- Upskill their teams in practical AI
- Build and deploy robust AI agents and tools
- Accelerate delivery and reduce wasted effort
- Create a culture of innovation and technical excellence

Get started by answering a few questions:

## For Technical Leaders and Builder Teams

If you lead an engineering team or organisation, or are a technical founder, you are my focus. My content, workshops, and tools are designed for those who want to deliver AI results fast, without the fluff. I work with:

- CTOs and engineering managers who want to upskill their teams
- Technical founders and startup teams looking for a competitive edge
- Senior engineers who want to build and deploy AI agents that work in production

You get practical, actionable guidance and hands-on support. I prioritise technical depth and real-world results, not generic advice. My network is full of technical leaders who trust me to deliver value, and I am here to help you do the same for your team.

If you are a technical founder or early-stage team, you will find the same depth and practical help here. The tools and content I create are for technical builders at any scale.

If you are a product or digital executive, you are welcome! I will be sharing more for non-technical leaders in the future.

## Services for Technical Teams

### 1. AI Workshops & Training

Custom, hands-on sessions for your engineering team. Go beyond theory: learn how to build, evaluate, and deploy AI agents and LLM-powered features in your real codebase. Sessions are tailored to your stack and your business needs. Example topics:

- Building robust LLM applications (with evals, monitoring, and safety)
- Integrating AI agents into existing products
- Best practices for developer productivity with AI tools
- Code reviews and architecture sessions focused on AI/ML

### 2. AI Agent & Tooling Prototyping

Get a working prototype, not just a slide deck. I work alongside your team to design, build, and ship AI-powered features or internal tools. You get:

- Rapid proof-of-concept builds (weeks, not months)
- Technical documentation and handover
- Guidance on scaling from prototype to production

### 3. Technical AI Audits & Roadmaps

A focused, technical review of your current systems and opportunities for AI. I identify quick wins, technical risks, and a clear path to value. Deliverables include:

- Code and architecture review (with actionable recommendations)
- Prioritised roadmap for AI adoption
- Concrete next steps for your team

### 4. Ongoing Technical Advisory & Coaching

Retainer-based support for technical leaders who want a trusted expert on call. I provide:

- Regular check-ins and ad hoc support
- Review of AI/ML initiatives and vendor choices
- Help with hiring, upskilling, and team structure for AI

## How I Work

Every engagement is tailored. I start with a strategy call to understand your team, your codebase, and your goals. I do not waste time on generic frameworks or endless slides. You get direct, technical advice and hands-on help, focused on what will move the needle for your team.

If you want to see how I work, join a [webinar](/webinar) or request a code review. If you are ready to move fast, we can start prototyping together within days. Fill in a few questions to get started:

## What happens next?

The first step is a free strategy call. I will listen to your challenges, help you clarify what you want to achieve, and show you where AI can make a real difference. No jargon. No hard sell. Just practical advice and a clear next step.

If it makes sense, I will suggest a technical AI audit. This is a focused engagement where I pinpoint the areas where AI can deliver the most value for your team, highlight quick wins, and map out what a transformation could look like. You will get a clear, actionable plan in a matter of days to take the first steps to transforming your engineering practice.

You can then take this plan forward yourself or have me help you implement it.

If you already know what you want, I offer fixed term coaching or retainers so you have expert support when you need it.

## Real results

I have helped engineering teams deliver much more with vastly fewer resources, built LLM features that shipped to production, and enabled technical founders to scale their impact. My approach is always practical, technical, and focused on results.
