    <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 text-brand-black">The Email Anxiety Trap</h2>

    <div class="prose prose-lg text-brand-black/80 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>This summer, whilst I was supposed to be on holiday in Salcombe, I caught myself checking email constantly.</p>

      <p>I had left notifications on because I was terrified of missing something urgent. But I was drowning in noise. Every ping could be important. Or it could be yet another newsletter I had forgotten to unsubscribe from.</p>

      <p>The choice felt inevitable: deep focus or fear of missing critical emails. An hour a day wasted fluttering to my inbox, just in case. That is weeks of lost time every year.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- The Solution -->
  <div class="mb-12 bg-brand-white rounded-lg p-8 border border-brand-light-blue/20">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 text-brand-black">Meet Em</h2>

    <div class="prose prose-lg text-brand-black/80 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>Em is an AI email triage system. She checks your Gmail every minute, decides what is urgent using AI, and only pings you about what actually matters.</p>

      <p>No more constant checking. No more notification anxiety. No more drowning in irrelevant emails whilst terrified of missing the important ones.</p>

      <p class="font-semibold text-brand-deep-turquoise">Email checks: 40+ per day → 5 per day</p>

      <p>Em has processed hundreds of emails. She learns what "urgent" means to you specifically. When she gets it wrong, you can teach her through Slack reactions and thread messages, and she'll do better next time.</p>

  <!-- How It Works -->
  <div class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 text-brand-black">Production-Ready AI</h2>

    <div class="prose prose-lg text-brand-black/80 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>Em is not a prototype. She is built with internet-first architecture for security. Email content goes to Kaijo for analysis, then no further internet contact to prevent data exfiltration.</p>

      <p>An eval system continuously improves her decisions. She learns your definition of urgent, not mine.</p>
