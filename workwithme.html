      <h2>How I can help you</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I can join your team as an experienced programmer. I aim to add lots of value as quickly as possible, whilst producing clean reusable code. I coach less experienced team members where appropriate.</li>
        <li>I can help your team to improve their responsiveness to change and to become more proficient in Ruby and test automation.</li>
        <li>I practice and teach the principles of clean code wherever I go, and can guide you as you improve your own practice.</li>
        <li>I can teach your teams introductory Ruby, test-driven development and good use of Cucumber through participatory 1 - 3 day training courses.</li>
      </ul>
