    "Excellent balance of theory and practice! Chris delivered content at just the right pace, mixing technical depth with practical applications we can implement immediately. The hands-on tasks were particularly valuable, and I especially appreciated learning about building workflow agents - a concept fairly new to me. Really valuable course for our team... we'll definitely be putting this to use!"
