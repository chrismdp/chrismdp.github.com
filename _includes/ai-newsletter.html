    <h2>Get ahead with AI.</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0;">AI has changed the world forever. New AI products come out every day. Everyone else seems to be moving fast and it's easy to feel left behind.<br><br>

    I've dedicated myself to learning the very latest AI tools and techniques and have used my experience as a founder and CTO of multiple businesses to separate out hype from what works now.<br><br>

    <strong>I've applied what I've learned so far to my own businesses, and it's transforming everything. It can for you too.</strong>
