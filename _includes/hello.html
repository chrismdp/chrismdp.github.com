<p>I am an itinerant agilist, programmer, writer and trainer.</p>

<p>I consult in technical architecture and agile management, and I train and coach teams in BDD, automated, testing, clean code and great team practices. I train publicly at <a href='http://bddkickstart.com'>BDD Kickstart</a> and make <a href='http://soltrader.net'>Sol Trader</a>.</p>

<p>I was the owner of the Ruby shop Eden Development, which led the way in applying the BDD process to client projects. More recently, I designed the hosting infrastructure and was one of the leading developers on <a href='http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk'>e-petitions</a>, a high profile web application that was written using BDD techniques and had 17 million visits in its first year. Clients have included large organisations such as the <a href='http://bbc.co.uk'>BBC</a> and <a href='http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/'>Cabinet Office</a> (working at <a href='http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about/'>GDS</a> on the new <a href='http://gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a> platform) as well as a number of startups.</p>

<p>I have spoken on Ruby, Cucumber, being agile, code quality and programmer education at conferences including Rubyconf, the Scottish Ruby Conference, and Software Craftsmanship North America and Software Craftsmanship UK.</p>
