&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin&quot;&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often argued that certification is a bad thing. I would say that certification is not good or bad: it is rather the certifier and the manner of the certification that can be good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certification is just recommendation mass produced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation is very valuable, but only if I trust the recommender. If a trusted friend recommends the work of another, I will listen hard. If that recommender is a faceless corporation, then I won’t pay so much attention. If that corporation has been paid to recommend someone to me, then I will pay even less attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest we seek to win the recommendations of trusted people through a good track record, rather than paying a corporation to recommend (read: certify) us. Those who have mass produced their recommendations through a paid certification scheme are not likely to carry weight with anyone after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
