To this end I've put up a [new page](/workwithme.html) on this site which has all the details of what I can offer, and my availability. If you'd like to work with me this autumn, do [get in touch](mailto:chris@thinkcodelearn.com).

I also plan to start blogging again soon, with my first topic being [how we handled the massive site traffic](/2011/08/e-petitions-handling-traffic) we experienced on e-petitions [a couple of weeks ago](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14474429).

By all means peruse the following pieces of history:

* [The Spring: Richclient series](/2006/04/spring-richclient)
* [SVG Planner Index cards](/2006/10/svg-planner)
* [TDD: Tortoise and the the Hare](/2006/02/tdd-the-tortoise-and-the-hare)

I'm moving servers and these would have previously vanished from the net. They still get plenty of traffic so it makes sense to keep them around for posterity. Drop me a line if you find them interesting!

I achieved the following:

* Forked a whole blog (yes, a whole blog, git is great too) from [James](http://github.com/ohthatjames/ohthatjames.github.com).
* Vimmed and ackked my way through, changing all James' references to my own
* Wrote my first post
* Set up feedburner to point to the correct blog
* Aggregated my blog feed on our new [staff blogs feed](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/blogs/).
* Set up Disqus for commenting

But how long, how long, I hear you ask? _Twenty minutes_, that's how long. Previously I spent about _three hours_ fiddling around with drupal to set up my last blog. The joys of simple tools, doing one thing stupidly well.

This blog will contain wonderful insightful witty comment on many things, such as business, code, crafting and life.

It's likely to stay fairly technical (this is a github page after all), and include updates from the mentoring of the awesome developers I'm currently mentoring, [James Hunt](http://ohthatjames.github.com) and [Richard Patching](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/blogs/richard).

Do [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ChrisParsons) if you want to be kept up to date.
